  <h1>Dear Brianna,</h1>
  <p>I must say that these past few weeks have been truly something.
    Like we always say, it feels that we've been together for much longer.
    Probably because we've been having so much fun in the infatuation stage of
    our relationship. I've been thinking about some things and I just want to get
    them off my chest.</p>
  <h2>How I Feel About You</h2>
  <p>Since I met you I knew I wasn't good enough. As a man I already have the
    preconcieved notion of what we are and my goals with you.
    These are all low frequency thoughts though. Things like sex and ego.
    The higher levels consists of energy exchanges through conversation and insight,
    how we can be intrigued by something and looking it up just to go Ahhh! These
    events make me feel not low and show me that you're someone I can connect with
    beyond the physical.</p>
  <h2 class="pink">My Flaws</h2>
  <p>As I am, I have to tell you I'm not the easiest person to get along
    with. Things may seem okay now (and they are), but I can be a spoiled and
    selfish person. It wasnt until I started looking inward and going with the flow
    did I even make the attempt to change that side of me. As an air sign
    I've been told I have options, and naturally I explore them. I can see this
    in my life in a lot of situations. I can also be very distant and aloof. Which
    is why providing reassurance seems to go over my head sometimes. These are things
    that I'm working on to be a better person in general.</p>
  <h2>My Fears</h2>
  <p>Telling you that I love you was probably the hardest thing for me to do
    in a long time. Partially because I told myself that I wouldn't love anymore because
    its for suckers, and nothing last. I'm afraid that I will eventually mess us up,
    like I've done in previous relationships. Me being in control of my essense
    is important not only for me to gain power within myself but to
    have a foundation laid to be a better man for you, in numerous areas. I've learned that when
    its low I'm more susceptible to come from those low frequencies.</p>
  <h2 class="pink">My Intentions</h2>
  <p>This goes against power you know? Telling you my intentions. I know I
    can create situations by thinking them and I can will things into existence.
    Whether its good or bad.
    I will say this, part of me doesn't want to "predict the future with you".
    Its scary to think that someone like you who's been good to me will hate me because I hurt you.
    Love hurts and to me it seems that heartbreak is part of that cycle. I
    can say that in this moment while I type these words I want you
    to be successful in your goals and happy in your mind. I would love to
    always be a positive person in your life no matter what happens. I love you Brianna❤
